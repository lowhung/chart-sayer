# Chart Sayer: Product Specification

## Vision

Chart Sayer aims to be the premier automated trading chart analysis solution that bridges the gap between technical analysis and position management for traders. By leveraging computer vision and AI, Chart Sayer extracts critical trading information from chart images and provides a seamless experience for tracking positions across multiple platforms.

## Core Problem

Traders frequently share and analyze chart images on social platforms like Discord and Telegram, but there's a disconnect between this analysis process and the actual position management. Currently, traders must:

1. Manually interpret charts shared in chat channels
2. Record entry/exit points separately in spreadsheets or other tools
3. Manually track position performance over time
4. Switch contexts between analysis and position management frequently

Chart Sayer solves this by creating an integrated workflow where chart analysis automatically feeds into position tracking, all accessible within the platforms traders already use.

## Target Users

- **Active Traders**: Day traders and swing traders who actively share chart analysis
- **Trading Communities**: Discord and Telegram groups focused on trading
- **Trading Educators**: Those who teach technical analysis and want to track student performance
- **Algorithmic Traders**: Those who want to combine technical signals with position tracking

## Core Features

### 1. Chart Image Analysis

  - Command groups for chart analysis and position management to maintain organization
  - TradingView chart rendering directly within Discord for enhanced visualization
  - Conversational follow-ups after chart analysis to assist with position creation
- **Telegram Bot**: Similar capabilities in Telegram, with platform-specific optimizations
- **Real-time Price Data**: Integration with market data providers (e.g., CoinMarketCap) for current pricing information

### 4. Risk Management

## Technical Architecture

### Components

1. **FastAPI Backend**: Core application server handling requests and business logic
2. **Redis Storage**: Fast, in-memory database for position tracking and caching
3. **Bot Adapters**: Platform-specific modules for Discord and Telegram
4. **Image Processing Engine**: Computer vision pipeline for chart analysis
5. **Machine Learning Module**: AI components for pattern recognition and prediction

### Data Flow

1. User uploads chart image to Discord/Telegram
2. Bot sends image to Image Processing Engine
3. Extracted data is processed and stored as a new position
4. User can query and manage positions through the bot interface
5. Updates flow back through the system to keep all platforms in sync
